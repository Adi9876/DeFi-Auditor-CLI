# DeFi Auditor CLI

**DeFi Auditor CLI** is a modular command-line tool for auditing Solidity smart contracts. It automates vulnerability detection using Slither and custom static analyzers, with a vision to integrate AI for deeper, contextual security insights.

## Features

- 🔍 Static analysis powered by [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)
- ⚠️ Detects logic flaws and security vulnerabilities
- 🤖 AI-driven analyzers (coming soon)
- 🔄 Easily extendable for multi-chain contract analysis
- 📄 Designed for rich, actionable audit report generation

## In Development

- AI-based reasoning on top of static output
- Automated report generation in Markdown/PDF
- Plugin-based architecture for broader static/dynamic tooling
- Support for additional blockchain ecosystems

## Tech Stack

- **Python** — CLI + static logic
- **Solidity** — Contract target language
- **Slither** — Base static analyzer
- **Custom Static Modules** — Extensible analysis logic
- *(AI integration pipeline planned)*
