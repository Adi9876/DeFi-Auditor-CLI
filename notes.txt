Shifted these initial notes will try to write down flow here and smaller comments in code:

    # we'll first need to fetch and get all the data for the audit to be done
    """1. Smart Contract(s) itself
            - either by fetching it through etherscan (for staring) via address (if its verified) (will add it later)
            - either by getting it from user itself ##### would be better is unverifeid/ undeloyed as well (firstly)
       2. ABI code ??
       3. ByteCode if required ??
    """

    # - - - - -> -> -> we'll use class structure (suggested by GPT)

    #lets just first take input files from user.

__________________________

Now that we have our files we now perform
    - Static Analysis on it first (to hold on to some issues)
    - Slither
    - (will try if we can use solidity: metrics in report or here)

    > for this static analyzer i think another class should be used instead ? edit: Yes

__________________________

Update: -> we have files loaded, 
        -> slither analyzed those files, and that data is stored.
        -> we should now analyze the contracts for gas optimization .. 
                            -> which includes (storage usage, loops, function visibility etc.)
